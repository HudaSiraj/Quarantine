                            <p> Here's a simplified Corona Tracker to keep up with the latest updates
                                on the situation. These are usually updated every 12 hours, so check back. Sadly 
                                there is only much information I can cram on a website, so this data is only for the United States. I will be sure to add 
                                more updates for flexibility of location!

                               it made some of us unproductive. Well, to overcome that we must 
                               plan out everything we do. Use this to-do list to your advantage!
